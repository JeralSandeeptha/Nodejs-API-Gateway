# Nodejs-API-Gateway
In this project I learnt about how to make an API gateway.

### This is also knwown as API gateway / Microservices Architechture
(1.) Microsesrvices are collections of small independent and loosely coupled services.
(2.) Each service focus on a single service / feature.
(3.) Can be developed and deployed independently.
(4.) Faster development.
(5.) Better fault isolation.
(6.) Can be different programming language for each service.
(7.) New features can be added easily without affecting whole application.
